# Hostel Allocation Software

## Description:

This is an application created to manage and allocate hostel spaces to students of a Nigeria University. The application was built for the client and they later decided not to use the application. It might come in useful to someone ,that's why I am making this open-source. The readme is a work in progress.

The application was created using the following technologies:
* NODEJS
* React
* MongoDB
* Redis 
* Docker
* Docker-Compose

## Getting Started:

Install Docker and Docker-Compose on your development machine. 

To build and start the project run: 
>  docker compose -f "docker-compose-dev.yml" up -d --build
